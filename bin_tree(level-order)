//Level order traversal, also known as Breadth first traversal is a traversal technique adopted in Binary tree to visit all nodes of it level-by-level.It starts from the top level
of the tree and then progresses towards its last level.According to this traversal,you cannot move to next level unless you visit all the nodes of the previous level.

//The binary tree would be given to you in the question.

public static void levelOrder(Node root) 
{
    //Creating a queue to store the nodes.
    Queue<Node> trv=new LinkedList<>();
    
    //Base case.
    trv.offer(root);
    
    //Algorithm.
    while(!trv.isEmpty())
    {
    Node temp=trv.peek();
    //Visiting the node at front of queue.
    System.out.print(temp.data+" ");
    //Pushing children of visited node into the queue.
    if(temp.left!=null)
    trv.offer(temp.left);
    if(temp.right!=null)
    trv.offer(temp.right);
    //Popping out the visited node from the queue.
    trv.poll();
    }
