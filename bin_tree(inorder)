//Inorder traversal is a type of Depth first traversal technique,in which the left subtree of a binary tree is visited first and then it's root node is visited and at last it's right subtree is visited.

//The binary tree would be given to you in the question.

//Recursive implementation of Inorder traversal.

void inOrder( struct node *root)

    if(root==NULL)
    return;
    
    inOrder(root->left);
    printf("%d ",root->data);
